## Eccomerce Application

# Description

This project was created to make the backend for an eccomerce site. I use express, sequelize,and postgresSQL to create the database and routes. It was tested on insomina. Understanding how to create models and routes with a relational database was both challenging and fun.

# Installation

To install run nom install as all the packages you will need are in the library.

# Usage

to use this application you will need PGAdmin as well as your favorite API testing product such as insomina or Postman.
